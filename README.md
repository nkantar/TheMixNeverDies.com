# TheMixNeverDies.com

[**The Mix Never Dies**] (**TMND**) is a website of Nik’s Spotify “Liked Songs” playlist.
As the tagline says, Nik likes these choonz.


## Overview

TMND is a static website generated from the content of my Spotify “Liked Songs” playlist.

It’s got a homepage with the last 7 days of songs, and a daily archive.

The whole thing is generated using [Python], [Poetry], [spotipy], [Jinja], [python-dotenv], [dateutil], and all their dependencies, and is deployed on [Netlify].
The deployment runs on every change to the `main` branch, and daily at 3:11AM Pacific via [GitHub Actions].


## Contributing

Unlike most of my projects, contributions are not explicitly encouraged, though they’re not discouraged, either.

If there’s any real interest, I’d be open to turning this into something usable by others.
However, I’m quite skeptical about that being the case, so…
